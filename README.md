# qurricane

## Introduction

Qurricane is one of Qubit's open source projects. The idea was to create a very lightweight but highly customizable asynchronous HTTP server. Qurricane has been designed with ease of usability in mind, see example section to check on how it's achieved.

## Design Key Points
* Performance
* Usage Simplicity
* Flexibility
* Configurability

### Performance
Qurricane uses Java asynchronous NIO API for handling connections traffic, it consist on a thread pools that handle R/W operations. There is a separate thread that is dedicated for accepting only connections stage and it is working in non-blocking mode. Qurricane is designed to be able to put hardware to it's limits, but can be configured to be slown down via server options.
Each thread from handling pool maintain its own "jobs" queue which correspond to incoming connections. There is 3 types of handling threads:
* pool - this type is a simplest one and uses atomic reference array with constant size created upon server start. It is safest and lightest way that stores thread jobs. 
* pool-shared - same type as pool but all threads share same pool.
* queue - this type is similar to "pool" but uses concurrent list instead of statically sized array like in "pool" case. While "pool" type thread scans the array to find jobs to do, this thread peeks jobs from head and add to tail. Each thread of "queue" type maintain its own local queue.
* queue-shared - this is same as "queue" type with the difference that all threads share same concurrent queue. This type of jobs may work better for servers that perform slow asynchronous operations and threads can stuck for long time in one place.

In most of the cases, "pool" will be absolutely fine choice (and best). If you are not sure, just leave defaults - server by default is configured to use "pool" type of thread jobs collection. It does also check how many cpu-s is in the system in orther to estimate amount of used threads.

Server processing for requests is limited to almost absolute minimum, while request URL and headers will be recognised, extended functionality like parsing url parameters or POST body parameters is not included. There is a wide choice of API that can be used for parsing parameters.
Qurricane focuses solely on performance and flexibilty, it is able to quickly test your hardware I/O limits.

### Usage Simplicity
Qurricane requires a Server instance to be created to start processing requests. Service handlers can be added at any time to the server class. To create typical server application all is needed is a server instance and handler classes that will implement how to handle request. See examples section for more details.

### Flexibility
Server configuration is very configurable. Handling threads amounts (pools), jobs queues size, processing delays and many more options are adjustable to system needs. By default system checks available cpus and will create 4 handling threads for each cpu to handle requests. Server can be easily configured to use little resources and to slow down IO, throughput of the server is a result of setting buffer size and "breaks" latencies during data polling in the queues. It can be configured to response very fast but to limit transfer speeds or vice versa. Delays can be controlled on each processing level.

Qurricane is extremely small but can serve same heavy loads and application complexity as fully featured "official" servers such as tomcat, jboss or glassfish.

##Examples

To create server instance:

```
import com.qubit.qurricane.Server;
import com.qubit.qurricane.examples.EchoHandler;

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Server server = new Server("localhost", 3456);

	// custom setup
	server.setRequestBufferSize(32 * 1024); // this is buffer for readin, buffers for reading are hold by threads
	server.setJobsPerThread(256);
  	server.setThreadsAmount(16);
  	server.setDataHandlerWriteBufferSize(1024); // this is buffer for writing back, those buffers are hold by 
  												// data handler objects. 
  												// Data handler objects are the jobs in threads queues.
  	server.setDefaultIdleTime(25 * 1000);		// This is how long server will wait for R/W before closing connection.
  												// This property is configurable on handler level.
  	server.setDelayForNoIOReadsInSuite(30);		// This property indicates how many milisconds thread will sleep 
  												// if there is no I/O occuring in its queue (queue having jobs!).
  												// Threads sleeping can be waked at any time if accepting connection
  												// thread is updating the queue.
  	server.setSinglePoolPassThreadDelay(0);		// This is how to set any delay between "rounds" of 
  												// reading/writing from/to jobs. Value larger than zero will cause a sleep
  												// every time thread is checking queue for I/O (read/write -> wait etc.).
  												// This is a direct way to slow down server - when necessary.

  	server.registerHandlerByPath("/echo", new EchoHandler()); //register demo handler (echoing data back)

  	server.start(); // start the server
}
```

Clearly node and tomcat are not able to use whole I/O potential of the machine.
