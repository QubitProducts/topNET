# topNET

## Introduction

topNET is a fast and small HTTP server. The idea is to have a very lightweight but highly customizable asynchronous HTTP server. topNET has been designed with ease of usability in mind, see example section to check on how it's achieved.
This server, when correctly configured can perform on NGINX level of performance, benchmarks provided are agains most populare http servers.

## Design Key Points
* Performance
* Usage Simplicity
* Flexibility
* Configurability

### Performance

topNET is design to behave and look similar to J2EE specification but only on a basic level.

Implementation produced two server versions, one is based on a typical event only based R/W operations wakups and a second version where all R/W operations are handled in full isolation by handling threads, the main difference is that main accept loop in event based version case wakes threads to process some R/W when they become available where second version does only accepting connections and let threads to decide on their own when they should be awake for R/W operations.
Both versions have similar performance in average use case, however under heavy load - server may be be faster and have better latency for the second case where accept loop only accepts connections (in this case when no job has anything to R/W thread will sleep for short time).

Both versions have equal functionality, to use event only based server, use:
```
com.qubit.topnet.PureEventsTypeServer
```
for wait based server type:
```
com.qubit.topnet.AcceptOnlyEventsTypeServer
```

topNET uses 3 types of handling threads (pool is default):
* pool - this type is a simplest one and uses atomic reference array with constant size created upon server start. It is safest and lightest way that stores thread jobs. 
* queue - this type is similar to "pool" but uses concurrent list instead of statically sized array like in "pool" case. While "pool" type thread scans the array to find jobs to do, this thread peeks jobs from head and add to tail in typical FILO manner. Each thread of "queue" type maintain its own local queue instance.
* queue-shared - this is same as "queue" type with the difference that all threads share same concurrent queue. This type of jobs may work better for servers that perform slow asynchronous operations and threads can stuck for long time in one place.

In most of the cases, "pool" will be absolutely fine and best choice. If you are not sure, just leave the defaults - server by default use "pool" type. Default configuration does also check how many cpu-s is in the system in orther to estimate amount of used threads (if there is many cpus/core there will be more threads assigned).

By default server is configured to autoscale handler threads amount whenever necessary and to downscale when necessary.

Server processing is limited to almost absolute minimum, while request URL and headers will be parsed, extended functionality like parsing url parameters or POST body parameters is not included. 
There is a wide choice of API that can be used for parsing parameters and will be added to topNET in near future.
topNET focuses solely on performance and flexibility.

Server supports protocol up to HTTP/1.1 (including keep-alive).

### Usage Simplicity
topNET requires a Server instance to be created to start processing requests. 
Service handlers can be added to server class and can be chained, there is many 
way how your application can chain processing and choose which url/method is bounded 
to which handler. There is plenty of choice in terms of customization.
To create typical server application all is needed is a server instance and handler 
classes that will implement how to handle request. See examples section for more 
details.

### Flexibility
Handling threads amounts (pools), jobs queues size, processing delays and many 
more options are adjustable to system needs. By default system checks available 
cpus and will create adequate handling threads amount for each cpu to handle requests.
Server can be easily configured to use little resources and to slow down it's IO, throughput of the server is a result of setting buffer size and "breaks" latencies during data polling in the queues. It can be configured to response very fast but to limit transfer speeds or vice versa. 
Delays can be controlled on each processing level.

topNET is extremely small but can serve same heavy loads and application complexity as fully featured "official" servers such as tomcat, jboss or glassfish. Being very small and highly customizable it's an excellent solution as for mobile devices as for powerful desktop stations.


##Examples

To create server instance:

```java
import com.qubit.topnet.AcceptOnlyEventsTypeServer;
import com.qubit.topnet.examples.EchoHandler;

public static void main(String[] args) {
	AcceptOnlyEventsTypeServer server = 
        new AcceptOnlyEventsTypeServer("localhost", 3456);

	server.setMaxGrowningBufferChunkSize(64 * 1024); 
        // this is a growing buffer size limit.
        // Growing buffer, is a class that is used to store data for R/W operations. 
        // topNET uses dedicated buffer chain for R/W operations, 
        // each chain chunk will have maximum size of specified by this setter.

	server.setJobsPerThread(256);
        // how many jobs each thread can have (max)
  	
    server.setThreadsAmount(16);
        // maximum amount of threads

  	server.setDefaultIdleTime(25 * 1000);
        // This is how many miliseconds server will wait for R/W 
        // before closing connection.
  		// This property is also configurable on a handler level.

  	server.setDelayForNoIOReadsInSuite(30);
        // (only for accept type server)
        // This property indicates how many nanoseconds thread will sleep (if
        // value is larger than 1000000 then it corresponds to value miliseconds after dividing by 1000000).
  		// Wait occurs when if there is no I/O occuring in entire threads queue 
        // (queue having jobs but none has anything to read or write!.
  	
  	server.registerHandlerByPath("/echo", new EchoHandler());
        //register demo handler (echoing data back)

  	server.start();
        // start the server
}
```
